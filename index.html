            <h1> <strong>Food House Information</strong></h1>
            <p>"Food House" project is formerly known as a restaurant opening for public business, which has a typical
                vintage architectural style of the 70’s and 80’s. The project enjoys a relatively favorable geographic
                location and an extensive view with the windows facing the boundless ocean. The owner of the project
                mainly expects to repair and refine the building’s appearance, combining with new functional
                requirements and responding to the surroundings, so that the indoor and outdoor can be a unified
                temperament to enable building to integrate better into the environment. <br>
                Firstly, the design is started from inside and outside moving lines to make people believe that the
                design is for a better use of the product itself; therefore, combing moving lines inside and outside the
                building is a primary problem. </p>

        <h1>My Choices</h1>
        <p>My Food Choice was introduced in 2017 as a new, more personalised way of serving patient meals in NSW public
            hospitals. My Food Choice uses technology to cut the time between ordering and receiving meals to under 4
            hours and gives patients a menu of up to 18 hot meals at lunch and dinner.</p>
