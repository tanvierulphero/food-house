                <h1> <strong>Food House Information</strong></h1>
                <p>"Food House" project is formerly known as a restaurant opening for public business, which has a
                    typical
                    vintage architectural style of the 70’s and 80’s. The project enjoys a relatively favorable
                    geographic
                    location and an extensive view with the windows facing the boundless ocean. The owner of the project
                    mainly expects to repair and refine the building’s appearance, combining with new functional
                    requirements and responding to the surroundings, so that the indoor and outdoor can be a unified
                    temperament to enable building to integrate better into the environment. <br>
                    Firstly, the design is started from inside and outside moving lines to make people believe that the
                    design is for a better use of the product itself; therefore, combing moving lines inside and outside
                    the
                    building is a primary problem. </p>

            <p>My Food Choice was introduced in 2017 as a new, more personalised way of serving patient meals in NSW
                public
